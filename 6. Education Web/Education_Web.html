            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The history of education studies the processes, methods, and
                institutions involved in teaching and learning. It tries to explain how they have interacted with each
                other and shaped educational practice until the present day.Education began in prehistory, as
                adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. For the most
                part, there were no specialized teachers and most adults taught the youth, usually informally during
                everyday activities. Education was achieved through oral communication and imitation. It could take the
                form of storytelling and singing to pass knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next.

            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The main discipline investigating education is called education studies,
                also referred to as education sciences. It tries to determine how people transmit and acquire knowledge
                by studying the methods and forms of education. It is interested in its aims, effects, and value as well
                as the cultural, societal, governmental, and historical contexts that shape education. Education
                theorists integrate insights from many other fields of inquiry, including philosophy, psychology,
                sociology, economics, history, politics, and international relations. Because of these influences, some
                theorists claim that education studies is not an independent academic discipline like physics or history
                since its method and subject are not as clearly defined. Education studies differs from
                regular training programs, such as teacher training, since its focus on academic analysis and critical
                reflection goes beyond the skills needed to be a good teacher. It is not restricted to the topic of
                formal education but investigates all forms and aspects of education.</p>
